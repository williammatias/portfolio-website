                At vanguard, I'm a full stack web developer. This means I'm well
                versed in both end of the stack (Back-end and Front-end). For
                the front-end of the stack, I'm currently using the Angular
                framework with spectator a wrapper for jest to run unit test,
                scss for styling our web components and a container pattern for
                the development of my components.

                Here at ADP, I work as a team leader. The majority of my time is
                spent implementing new features for one of the company's main
                products (Workforce now). The remainder of my time is spent
                helping junior developers solve any blocking problems and guide
                them into a better system implementation. I also function as our
                team scrum master, helping the team prioritize our tasks during
                the sprints.

                At Direct Market Designs I was an intern responsible for the

                marketing campaigns created by the company. I worked with a team
                of graphic designers implementing their designs into the web.
                Moreover, I was in charge of organizing and programming all the
                multi-channel campaigns using a marketing automatization
                software created by a third-party vendor, which I was in
                constant communication with.
